I am using this in ubuntu (Cosmic Cuddlefish) <p>
Xfce<p>
The install date is bodged, you will have to enter your own install date OR remove the line<p>
Volume probably wont work for you, might have to make your own line there, mine was a PIA<p>
Cpus are good, might have to add or remove cpus based on how many you have.<p>
Temps are good<p><p>
top processes is good<p>
cpu bar is the average across all cpus<p>
top mem is good<p>
Conky, arch is gay, so is javascript<p>

logo good<p>
kernel spacing may need to be changed for your kernel, but thats the point of linux, a lil' DIY<p>
enviroment is good<p>
date is good<p>
desktop works, rename your desktops to make it less rubbish<p>
this line, oh boy, dont look at the code for this line, it gives the size of .xsession-errors in KB.<p>
